## Setup
Unzip each zip file, go to root directory first of the REST API and then the react app. Run npm install and then npm start to start each app and then test them.


## Usage
Select the appropriate icons to make changes to the exercise list.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- The UI for the app is very basic. Would eventually like to update the HTMl and CSS of the app to make it nicer to look at.

To do:
- Update the placement and color of the app to make it more presentable.
